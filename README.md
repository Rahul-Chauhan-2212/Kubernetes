<h5>Independent Container Orchestration</h5>
<p>Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.</p>

##### Problems with Manual Deployment
<ul>
<li>Manual Deployment of containers is hard to maintain, error-prone and annoying. These issues are beyond the security and configuration concerns.</li>
<li>Containers might do down/crash and need to be replaced.</li>
<li>We might need more containers when traffic spikes.</li>
<li>Incoming traffic should be distributed equally</li>
</ul>

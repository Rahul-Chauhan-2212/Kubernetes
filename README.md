<h5>Independent Container Orchestration</h5>
<p>Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.</p>

##### Problems with Manual Deployment
<ul>
<li>Manual Deployment of containers is hard to maintain, error-prone and annoying. These issues are beyond the security and configuration concerns.</li>
<li>Containers might go down/crash and need to be replaced.</li>
<li>We might need more containers when traffic spikes.</li>
<li>Incoming traffic should be distributed equally.</li>
</ul>

##### Why Kubernetes
<ul>
<li>Container health-checks and re-deplyoment</li>
<li>Auto-scaling</li>
<li>Load Balancer</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: These all problems are solved if we use AWS ECS, but we are locked to AWS. If we want to migrate to Azure or other cloud container service provider, then we have to learn about that service.</p>
